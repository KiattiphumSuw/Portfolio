# Portfolio Profile
Hello, I’m Tiger, a Computer Engineering student at Mahidol University with a passion for data and its transformative potential. My journey in the tech world has been driven by my enthusiasm for learning new skills and applying them to real-world problems. I’ve always been fascinated by how data drives the world forward, and I strive to be at the forefront of data-driven solutions that positively impact society. As someone who is friendly and easy to communicate with, I thrive in collaborative environments, and I’m always open to learning from others. <br><br>
My interests in Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering (MLE), and MLOps have led me to explore the end-to-end processes that fuel innovation, from data collection and engineering to model deployment and monitoring. I enjoy finding inventive ways to use data to solve problems and optimize processes. I firmly believe that data engineering is the foundation of impactful machine learning solutions, and I am dedicated to ensuring that the systems I work on are reliable, scalable, and efficient.
